## Update about the Change to the Dining Situation 

On July 9, 4 days before Congress begins, we learned of a change from the original understanding around Dining on Campus at PSU.  It turns out that contrary to previous understanding, participants in the US Go Congress won't be able to go to the Cafeteria in Ondine Hall unless they are staying in the dorms.  We appologize for any inconvenience this causes.  However, this may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.  In addition to multiple dining options that are literally inside the building where Congress is taking place, Portland is legendarily a foody city.  There are tons of restaurants, cafes and food carts within easy walking distance of Go Congress.  Literally any direction you could go you are bound to find somewhere delicious to dine.  Above is a simple guide to dining that is close to the venue.
