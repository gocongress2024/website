# Covid Policy

Updated: 2/17/24


The Congress Directors believe that circumstances have improved sufficiently to allow the event to be held with low risk. The situation may continue to change, and we will modify this policy as we get new information. However, we will need all attendees to follow whatever safety protocols we decide are necessary. Attendees unwilling to follow the Congress's Covid-19 policies may be excluded from events or asked to leave.


### Masking

Masks are not required, but please come prepared in case this changes.


### Testing

Temperature screening and rapid antigen tests will be available free at the Congress. If you are feeling ill or show a high temperature, let us know right away.


### If you test positive for COVID while at the Congress

If you develop COVID while at the Congress, the first level of response will be to ask you to "isolate in place". This may be in your original room, or in another room provided (at no extra cost) by the Congress and PSU. You will not be allowed to attend any further Congress events. If your symptoms remain mild, no further action will be needed.

If you require medical treatment or PCR testing, Congress staff will help make arrangements and provide transportation. You will be responsible for your own medical decisions and to pay for whatever medical services are rendered.


### Cancellations and Refunds

If an attendee becomes unable to attend the congress due to significant changes in COVID-19 related travel requirements, or documented COVID infection, either at their point of departure or for entry into the US, we will refund in full any payments made. This includes any attendees that have been denied a visa application.

Congress may be canceled if pandemic risk becomes too high to proceed. In that case, full refunds will be issued to all attendees.

For all other cases, the standard cancellation rules will apply.
