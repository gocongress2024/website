# Covid Policy

Updated: 6/27/2024


**The AGA is not requiring masks, COVID-19 vaccinations, or negative COVID-19 tests for any attendees at the 2024 US Go Congress.**  Attendees are encouraged to take available precautions, especially if at higher risk.

Attendees who wish to wear masks should bring their own. The AGA will have a limited supply of masks for those who request them. If you are wearing a mask, it is okay to request an opponent to wear one. They are encouraged but not required to do so. 

CDC guidance [(CDC updates and simplifies respiratory virus recommendations | CDC Online Newsroom | CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html)  “brings a unified approach to addressing risks from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses such as Covid-19, flu, and RSV. 
When people get sick with a respiratory virus, the updated guidance recommends that they stay home and away from others.
The recommendations suggest returning to normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, symptoms are improving overall, and if a fever was present, it has been gone without use of a fever-reducing medication.”

**The AGA reserves the right to alter this policy as needed, dependent upon public health conditions, as well as the most recent regulatory or guidance updates from federal, state, and local health authorities.**
