# Housing

- ### This year, all housing will be handled separately from registration. We have assembled several options for you to choose from. 
- ### All payments will be made to the site you reserve a room at. We will update the available rooms weekly.
- ### We may be able to increase our block sizes if they fill up. If you aren't able to get a room where you want one, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYnUirndbRpGD9Dgkaw-4vWLju7xcF7DkuT1f6F7lFH3Goig/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll notify you when the block increases or if it isn't possible for it to increase further.

### PSU Dorm Rooms
- PSU is offering limited dorm housing for attendees seeking to travel on a budget. Each room has two beds, and the registration must be in one person's name. Due to the limited supply, we ask that folks who are not coming with a roommate strongly consider the hotel options before booking a dorm room. 


- Please note that the walking distance from the dorms is often further than our hotel options. - - If you need a roommate you can submit your info [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3oquaHyPbL8nzx5fL4txGhBqBlmWXME83ux6ixSbwLHqSBA/viewform?usp=sf_link). We will attempt to match you as soon as possible, and will communicate via email if there are any delays. 

- If you run into trouble or have questions, please email registrar@usgocongress.com and we can help you.

- You can reserve a room and/or purchase a meal plan [HERE](Placeholder)
- Available rooms: 110
- Room Rate: $63/night, tax exempt
- Linen Pack: $54 one time fee with no exchanges. Linen pack includes flat sheet, fitted sheet, pillow w/case, blanket, body towel, hand towel, bath mat, washcloth.
