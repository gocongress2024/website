# Housing

- ### This year, all housing will be handled separately from registration. We have assembled several options for you to choose from. 
- ### All payments will be made to the site you reserve a room at. We will update the available rooms weekly.
- ### We may be able to increase our block sizes if they fill up. If you aren't able to get a room where you want one, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYnUirndbRpGD9Dgkaw-4vWLju7xcF7DkuT1f6F7lFH3Goig/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll notify you when the block increases or if it isn't possible for it to increase further.

### PSU Dorm Rooms
- PSU is offering limited dorm housing for attendees seeking to travel on a budget. Each room has two beds, and the registration must be in one person's name. Due to the limited supply, we ask that folks who are not coming with a roommate strongly consider the hotel options before booking a dorm room. 


- Please note that the walking distance from the dorms is often further than our hotel options. - - If you need a roommate you can submit your info <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3oquaHyPbL8nzx5fL4txGhBqBlmWXME83ux6ixSbwLHqSBA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">HERE</a>. We will attempt to match you as soon as possible, and will communicate via email if there are any delays. 

- If you run into trouble or have questions, please email PSU Housing at shc@pdx.edu and they can help you.
- You can reserve a room and/or purchase a meal plan <a href="https://event.starrezevents.com/582a6d9e-5593-4536-89e3-1eb19867d3e5/90af26ff-eec4-4d1e-9e4c-c50edad140ac" target="_blank">HERE</a>

## Meal Plan

PSU will be offering cafeteria food on a meal plan to those who are interested. If you are signing up to stay in the dormitories, you can buy your meal plan along with your housing. Meals cost $10.25 for Breakfast, $11.55 for Lunch, and $13.65 for Dinner. Meals can also be purchased at the door.

If you are staying somewhere else, you will still be able to buy the meal plan. You can do that through the PSU Housing portal <a href="https://event.starrezevents.com/582a6d9e-5593-4536-89e3-1eb19867d3e5/90af26ff-eec4-4d1e-9e4c-c50edad140ac" target="_blank">HERE</a>. You are not required to rent a PSU dorm room to buy a meal plan.
